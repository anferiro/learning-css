# Learning CSS
This repository will contain all the information that I've been learning about CSS.

## Introduction
I started my journey by doing the course Advance CSS and Saas: flexbox, grid, animations and more! in [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/lecture/8335936#overview)

But I realized that I am going to review the basics in order to move foward. Thus I found this map  of knowledge that I found quite usefull to go through.
