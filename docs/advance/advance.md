# Advance Course of CSS
## Introduction
I started my journey by doing the course Advance CSS and Saas: flexbox, grid, animations and more! in [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/lecture/8335936#overview)

- Course material: 
  
https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/advanced-css-course

- Updates & community

    👉 During the course, we use a couple of online tools and resources, which are all on my [resources page](http://codingheroes.io/resources/).

    👉 If you want to get updates on new courses or other important stuff, just follow me on twitter: @jonasschmedtman

    👉 We have a very friendly student community on Discord, where you can learn together with many like-minded people. Join by [clicking here](https://discord.gg/uhMkpf4)!

    👉 I also have a YouTube channel, but I haven't found time to be active there. You can still subscribe, as I might start posting videos in the future 😉


And now, have a ton of fun with the course! 😁✌️
